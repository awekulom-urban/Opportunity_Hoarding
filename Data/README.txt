The Child Opportunity Index (COI) 3.0 is a composite index of neighborhood features that help children thrive. COI 3.0 was first released in March 2024 and is updated annually. It builds on COI 2.0, which was released in 2020. The data available on this page is for 2020 census tracts, i.e., census tracts as defined for the 2020 Decennial Census.

	Child Opportunity Levels, Scores and composite z-scores for the overall index and three domains (2020 	census tracts)

	2_subdomain: COI 3.0 subdomains

This workbook, which mostly contains data attained from a query I ran using the above tool. In this sheet, census tracts are the unique identifier of the rows, found in the column, Tract. The other columns give details about a given census tract. 

Using these data, I have created a binary variable, found in the column labeled municipal incorporation indicator that has a value of one for tracts that fall within places that were incorporated in the 21stÂ century and zero otherwise. 
This code connect the Place level municipality data to the COI data in order to create the map.
